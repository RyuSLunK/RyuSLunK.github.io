    Game

  <p>Let me start off by saying I grew up with video games. NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, PS1, PS2, XBOX, XBOX 360, PS4, PC.</p>
  <p>But most of the time I would either have to wait for the systems to go down in price, at which time my friends would already have the next gen consoles.
    There was a big portion of my youth where I played a lot of browser games. I still do sometimes. Back in the day I was all over newgrounds, miniclip, and I am still a very active member of Kongregate.com (MY FAVORITE)</p>
    <p>Then came the dawn of the incremental game. You can just do a google search and you'll find a lot of them. I have been addicted to many different incremental game variants, whether it be on the desktop/laptop browser or on my phone.</p>
    <p>I initially played a lot of flash based games online. However, I didn't ever get into creating flash games because first off the adobe software is pretty expensive. Secondly, I've always been terrible at graphic design, art, drawing, which I felt was an essential component to what made a lot of my favorite flash games great.</p>
    <p>Then I started learning HTML and CSS. I loved how you could make something appear on any browser, on any device, by typing some code into notepad and having the result rendered on a browser screen. Then I started learning javascript. Then jQuery. jQuery was where my creativity really started to take off.</p>
    <p>By the time I graduated from college, HTML5 and Unity games were slowly starting to become as prominent as flash based games. So I've been thinking...I can make a website, I can code, I can design. Maybe I know enough now to make something that's fun to play? On any device?</p>
    <p>Not really sure what I want to make yet. It might be an RPG, RPG incremental, or side scrolling 2d action rpg. I don't want to stray too far out of my comfort zone with my first attempt, although I would love to see a day where I can make things that at least a few people can enjoy.</p>
    <p>I never really took the time to thank all those developers, programmers, graphic designers, flash ninjas, for giving me something to do all these years.</p>
    <p>Well, now I think I want to give other people something to do, by giving myself something to do.</p>
